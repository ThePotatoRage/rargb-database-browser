# RARGB-Database-Browser
As most of you probably heard, RARGB is no longer availble. There is a database available on the internet, which is pretty easy to find.
I wrote RARBG-Database-Browser to enable myself and everyone who wishes to easily browse the database and add magnets stratight to your default torrent client.

## How to use:
1. Install Python from python.org
2. Clone this project (the only file you need is browser.py).
3. Paste in the sqlite database in the same directory with the main.py file.
4. Run main.py.

## Disclaimer
This project was done in a few hours, by someone who basically just finished learning python. It may have some bugs and does not have many features. Contributions are certainly welcomed. Enjoy! :)
